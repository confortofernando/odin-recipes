        <h2>Fluffy French Toast</h2>
            <p>This French toast recipe is different because it uses flour. I have given it to some friends and they've all liked it better than the French toast they usually make!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 cup milk</li>
                <li>1 pinch salt</li>
                <li>3 eggs</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
                <li>12 thick slices bread</li>
            </ul>
